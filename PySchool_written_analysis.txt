A total of fifteen schools are within the PySchool system.  The entire system has a total of 39,170 students with a school budget of $24,649,428.  Of the 39,170 students, 74.98% pass math and 85.80% pass reading, while 65.17% pass both math and reading.  The purpose of this analysis is to seek factors that may have a sizable impact on students’ overall scores.When looking at spending per student, the top five schools with an overall passing rate of at least 90.5% spent between $578-$638 per student.  The bottom five schools all had a passing rate under 53.5% with a per student budget in the range of $637-$655.  Thus, a greater amount of spending per student is not indicative of an overall higher passing rate, and in fact, the more money allocated per student appears to even lessen the overall rate of students passing both reading and math.When looking at the type of schools present in the PySchool system, there are 8 charter and 7 district schools.  The overall passing rate for the charter schools is 90.43% while that of the district schools is 53.67%.  Thus, the type of school appears to have a sizable impact on the overall result of whether a student passes both reading and math, with students in charter schools outperforming their district counterparts.  If student success is of importance, then further investigations should focus on the mechanisms by which charter school outperform district schools.  Simply increasing funding per student seems to have a negligible (even perhaps deleterious) effect on student success.
